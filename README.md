# Uncommon Assembly Bug: Out-of-Bounds Memory Access

This repository demonstrates an uncommon but potentially dangerous bug in assembly code involving out-of-bounds memory access using scaled index addressing. The vulnerability arises from failing to validate the `ecx` register before using it in a scaled index calculation, potentially causing segmentation faults or access violations.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies within the `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]` instruction. If `ecx` is unvalidated and holds a large or unexpected value, the effective memory address calculation (`ebx+ecx*4`) might fall outside the allocated memory space, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable behavior.  This is particularly dangerous if the value of `ecx` originates from user input or an untrusted source.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing input validation and bounds checking to ensure that `ecx` holds a safe value before the memory access takes place. This can be achieved by adding checks to ensure `ecx` falls within an acceptable range before using it in the address calculation.  The example provided in `bugSolution.asm` demonstrates such a solution.

## Mitigation Strategies

* **Input Validation:** Always validate user inputs or external data before using them in memory address calculations.
* **Bounds Checking:** Explicitly check that the calculated memory address lies within the allocated memory space.
* **Defensive Programming:** Employ techniques to reduce the impact of potential vulnerabilities, such as using memory protection mechanisms provided by the operating system.
